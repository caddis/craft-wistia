![Craft Wistia](https://www.caddis.co/internal/repo/craft-wistia.svg)

Wistia is an incredible video marketing platform we rely on every day. Craft Wistia includes a configurable fieldtype to easily relate videos to entries and flexible tags to get video data and output embed code.

[Wistia Developer Docs â†’](https://wistia.com/doc/developers)

## Getting Started

To output videos on the front-end, use your field's handle and append the `getVideos` method. The getVideos method will return an array of videos or `false` if no videos are saved to your field.

```twig
{% for video in entry.videos.getVideos() %}
	<h2>{{ video.name }}</h2>
	{{ video.embed }}
{% endfor %}
```

### Inside a Matrix

```twig
{% for block in entry.matrixBlock %}
    {% if block.type == 'videos' %}
        {% for video in block.videos %}
            <h3>{{ video.name }}</h3>
            <img src="{{ video.preview.getUrl }}" alt="{{ video.name }}">
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

Pass your options as an object into the `getVideos` method.

```twig
{% set params = {
	autoPlay: true
	height: 420,
	width: 720
} %}

{% for video in entry.videos.getVideos(params) %}
	<h2>{{ video.name }}</h2>
	{{ video.embed }}
{% endfor %}
```

URL to the original video file.

### original.width

### preview.getUrl
Video screenshot. Default size: 1280px by 720px.

You can specify a width and/or height to resize the preview image. The image is center-cropped based on the size you specify. The width parameter is required to transform the image, otherwise the image will output the default size.

```twig
{{ video.preview.getUrl({
	width: 640,
	height: 360
}) }}
```

### project
The project associated with the video.

```
"project":{

  "name":"How They Work",
  "hashed_id":"ln2k6qwi9k"
}
```

### type
A string representing what type of media this is. Values can be **Video**, **Audio**, **Image**, **PdfDocument**, **MicrosoftOfficeDocument**, **Swf**, or **UnknownType**.

```
"type":"Video"
```

### thumbnail
The thumbnail image for the video. Refer to [Asset URLs - Tips & Tricks](https://wistia.com/doc/data-api#asset_urls__tips__tricks) for more information.

```
"thumbnail":{
  "url":"http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/7fbf9c2fe9c6585f9aa032f43f0aecc3f287e86b.jpg?image_crop_resized=100x60",
  "width":100,
  "height":60
}
```

#### Get a larger thumbnail url
To retrieve a larger thumbnail image, update the `image_crop_resized` query string in the thumbnail url.

```
{{ video.thumbnail.url|split('image_crop_resized')[0] ~ 'image_crop_resized=1044x514' }}
```

**Note:** It is more preferable to use the [preview.getUrl](#previewgeturl) tag since it caches the thumbnails on your server.

### updated
The date when the media was last changed.

```
"updated":"2013-10-28T20:53:12+00:00"
```

## CSV Import

The Wistia plugin provides compatibility with the [Import plugin](https://github.com/boboldehampsink/import).  Enter the name of the video in the video column of the .csv file. Make sure that the correct Wistia projects are selected for the field. If you want multiple videos saved on a single field, comma separate each video name in the column.

## Advanced

You can also override the default player color for all your videos site-wide. Add a "wistia.php" file within the "craft/config" directory and enter your desired color.

```php
<?php

return [
	'playerColor' => '#ff00ff'
];
```

## Installation

1. Move the "wistia" directory to "craft/plugins".
